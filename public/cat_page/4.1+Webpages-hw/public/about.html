      The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat,
      is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
      species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
      shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around
      7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges
      freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for
      companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are
      adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a
      strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night
      vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but
      a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

      Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling,
      grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
      frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes
      and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to
      adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems. Female domestic cats
      can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and
      throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging
      from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at cat fancy
      events as registered pedigreed cats. Population control includes spaying
      and neutering, but pet abandonment has exploded the global feral cat
      population, which has driven the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile
      species.

      Cats have been known to be associated with humans for at least 9,500 years
      and are currently the most popular pet in the world. In 2023, there were
      an estimated 220 million owned cats in the world, with 58 million in the
      United States alone. Cats are often referred to as "the purr-fect pet" due
      to their playful and affectionate nature.

      Domestic cats occur across the globe, though their popularity as pets
      varies by region. Out of the estimated 600 million cats worldwide, 400
      million reside in Asia, including 58 million pet cats in China. The United
      States leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats. In the United
      Kingdom, approximately 10.9 million domestic cats are kept as pets.
